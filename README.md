# msteams-haiku-bot

Energize your team chats with a dash of poetry! **msteams-haiku-bot** listens for messages that just happen to match the classic 17‑syllable footprint and recasts them in a playful 5-7-5 form. It's a lightweight way to sprinkle a bit of zen and fun into the development process.

## Project Structure

- `haiku_bot/` – Python package containing the bot logic
- `tests/` – unit tests powered by `pytest`

Run the tests with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest
```
